# Taniti-Prototype
HJN1-Task1 Project Approach And Prototype

### Notes
- This prototype reflects the low-fi wireframe and incorporates guerrilla testing feedback:
  - Nav label is “Plan & Book” (clear booking intent).
  - Partner booking notice shown before redirecting.
  - Itinerary feature is visible and persistent (drawer).
  - Buttons use strong contrast for outdoor readability.
